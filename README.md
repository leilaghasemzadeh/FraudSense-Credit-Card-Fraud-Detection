# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project implements a machine learning pipeline to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using the [Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) from Kaggle.

---

## Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)  
- **Size:** 284,807 transactions  
- **Class distribution:** Highly imbalanced â€” only 492 fraud cases (~0.17%)  

---

## Project Overview

The goal is to accurately identify fraudulent transactions through the following steps:

1. **Data Exploration & Visualization**  
   Analyze feature distributions and class imbalance.

2. **Preprocessing**  
   Scale numerical features (`Amount` and `Time`) using StandardScaler.

3. **Data Balancing**  
   Apply SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to the training set to address class imbalance.

4. **Model Training**  
   Train an XGBoost classifier on the balanced dataset.

5. **Evaluation**  
   Evaluate model performance with confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC AUC score.

6. **Feature Importance**  
   Visualize the most important features contributing to fraud detection.

7. **Model Persistence**  
   Save the trained model for future inference.

## Notes

- The dataset is **not** included in the repository due to size constraints.  
- Download the dataset manually from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) and place `creditcard.csv` in the project root.
